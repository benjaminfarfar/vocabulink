This is Vocabulink, the program that powers www.vocabulink.com.

This source distribution consists mostly of a literate Haskell CGI application,
but also contains the JavaScript, SQL, and CSS used by the site as well. It
contains everything you need to create a working copy of Vocabulink. It does

How to Build
============
Just run gmake. The program has not been built for Cabal as it's not intended
to be a general purpose application or library.

Note that I've only tested using GHC 6.8.3. GHC 6.10 won't work because of
changes to Control.Exception. To build on GHC 6.10, you can try the patches
provided by Henry Laxen. To apply the patches: patch -p1 < ghc.6.10.diff
