** How to get started learning another language.
** Why only link to the Hiragana/Katakana spelling of a word? Why not the Kanji or romaji, or some combination?
First of all, learn to understand Japanese words and sentences before you worry about the Kanji. I made that mistake myself. I put in a massive effort to learn how to write and pronounce the Kanji using James Hesig's books, long before I needed to. I thought it would be cool and "proper". In the end, much of it was wasted effort.

It's important that you are able to practice reading Japanese, but there are plenty basic level Japanese readers out there that use either only hiragana or furigana (hiragana above/below? the Kanji). Even once you outgrow those, you can use programs on your computer that will convert the Kanji into readable hiragana for you.

Proceeding this way will enable you to learn Kanji in context from your reading. Yes, at some point you will need to undertake disciplined study of the Kanji if you want to read and write at a high level, but why discourage yourself now and take away time from learning vocabulary?

As for romaji, many will agree that romaji is a crutch which will lead to bad pronunciation habits. With only 46? hiragana, it won't take long to learn them and get used to them as well as the roman alphabet.

Also, we want to apply the minimum information principle. As strange as it sounds, having both the hiragana and the romaji (let alone the Kanji) in your review actually makes things more difficult. Even though it's helpful information, your brain is trying to encode more at a time. If you know you only have to worry about hiragana (or katakana with imported words), some work is lifted from your brain.

If you do want to start studying the Kanji representation of words, go ahead and create a link from the hiragana version to the Kanji version. This allows you to practice directly in Japanese, maintains the minimum information principle, and allows you to employ another mnemonic for its study (one not based on sound but on Kanji meaning or appearance).
** Why we review links (associations) and not words. (There are few direct correlations between foreign words except for concrete nouns).
  [[file:~/project/vocabulink/vocabulink.cgi/vocabulink.sql::]]
** How to Create Memorable Mnemonics
** How to Evaluate/Rate Mnemonics
** Why only words and symbols? Why not grammar and sentences?
Because grammar and sentences are much harder to memorize, but much easier to learn with enough vocabulary.
Latin-based grammar study does not work. If you need to memorize verb forms, use associative links (jump -> jumped is to 躍り出る -> ?). If you need to memorize irregular verbs, use associative links with mnemonics.
Once you learn enough vocabulary, you'll be able to infer grammar rules from your reading and listening practice. The point of vocabulink is not to make you a fluent, it's to get you to the point where becoming fluent is fun and natural with enough interaction in the language.
* Ideas
** Build customized word frequency lists (and add hyperlinks to links) for different reading materials.

** Reviews
*** via email or SMS at the exact time necessary for review (with excludable ranges)
** Link Sets
*** 100 most common words
** Use social rankings and rewards
*** for creating associations and mnemonics
*** for accumulating/reviewing words
** Reading Review
*** Search the internet for text that appears in your review stack for reading practice.
** Directed Links
Links should be either uni-directional or bi-directional, and represented as such with appropriate arrows (--> or <-->). A uni-directional link will only be reviewed or displayed in that orientation, a bi-directional link will show up as 2 review items.

Simple associations, those with no mnemonic information attached, are bi-directional by default, but can be switched to uni-directional. Mnemonic associations are uni-directional by default, if the mnemonic makes sense in both directions. Otherwise, for bi-directional associations, there needs to be 2 mnemonics. It's important that you never try to study an association in the reverse direction with a uni-directional mnemonic.

The most important associations you'll study are from foreign word -> native word. That will help your reading and listening comprehension. It is important to study native word -> foreign word or you will have a difficult time expressing yourself, but keep it simple in the beginning.

(There should be an option to automatically add a review item in the reverse direction with no mnemonic once the mnemonic direction has become sufficiently stable. But we need to measure the effects.)
** Words vs Lexemes
Internally, we refer to the "thing" on either side of the association as a "lexeme" (define lexeme). This is because we review characters as well as words.

Should we differentiate? Only time will tell, I think.
** Vocabulink as an MMO
*** levels based on number of memorized (non-trivial?) links
*** lobby pairing system (like seen in Halo on XBox Live) for collaborative games
**** real-time translation
find a web page containing words in the shared pool of links for the gamers
** Second Life meetups
** Flash games based on link sets
*** RPG

*** Interesting premise that verbs are the most important and should be learned first because a language is abstract.
1. 20,000 words -Beginner to advanced in one program No program gives you this many words, we give you the whole language. Most programs give you pet phrases about ordering at a resturant, but we teach you to actaully speak the language. No other program does this. Further, our the intial focus is learning verbs. Verbs are what you need to understand a language. A language is abstract and verb centered. Most programs start with nouns like farm animals and fruits. To understand a sentence you need verbs first, as this is the action and meaning of the sentence.

2. 50 Songs - What is the easiest, fastest and most painless way to learn a language? With music. We have created beautiful songs in a specific way connecting the rhythm of the language to the rhythm of music. The easiest and most effective way to learn a language is with music.

3. 3000 mnemonics - Have trouble remembering words, make words stick to your memory in a fun way with a memory system that goes back as far back as ancient Greece. The Ancient Greeks would remember entire epics by heart with mnemonics. It has been proven with the test of time for 3000 years as well as modern scientific studies.

4. Etymology- a true breakthrough - Our etymology does not just teach you the history of words but its purpose is to give you connections to English. This way you remember a word not as a foreign word but a word that is related to your own native language. This is the most effective mnemonic there is. Your target foreign word can goes into your brain not as a foreign word but as simply a variation of English, your native language! This is a true breakthrough in language learning and no other program teaches in this way.

5. Brainwaves - Have fun with this accelerated method of learning. We created specific brainwaves, delta-theta for deep learning.

6. Fairy-tales - Be a child again and read about courageous princes and beautiful princesses.

7. Stories– Short interesting or funny stories that use the words you learned in context. Using your words in context is important.

8. Very practical conversation, Dialogues and the Socratic method - Learning key phrases and normal conversational situations will take you to a conversational level in your target language. But we use a form of the socratic method to draw make you think in the language.

We show you what is really important based on actual frequency of occurrence in conversation; therefore you will learn what is modern and even slang.

9. Grammar - Expressing complex things simply is the hallmark of creative effective design, this is what we have done with our grammar.

10. Native speakers - It puzzles me to this day why almost every program I have herd uses non-native speakers with foreign accents, or speak unrealistically quick and soft.  LearnFast use crisp, clear beautifully native speakers, who annunciate every syllable; when you are learning a language this is very important.

Kanji-lish 1.0
Kanjilish is a Firefox add-on that allows you to practice Japanese kanji while you read English (or other languages). It helps you learn the meaning of kanji. Since you have to read sometimes in your native language, you might as well practice kanji while you do it. What the program does is simple. It replaces the first letter of a word with a kanji of similar meaning. For example, the word read might appear as )

* Open Questions
** How do I harness the natural desire of people to do work to impress and help others? That's the force behind deviantART. What is the equivalent for language learning? It's got to go beyond making links and mnemonic stories...or does it? How can language learners express themselves and build a reputation?
** What do you do when you have a word that doesn't have a precise meaning in your native language or has multiple meanings?
