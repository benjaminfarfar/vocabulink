* Premises
AKA Why Should I Use Vocabulink?
** It's easiest to learn words for subjects you care about.
*** A network or related words helps you find words to learn that you care about. No more need to follow along with a textbook. The textbook may not teach you the word for "computer program".
*** As useful and general as "raincoat" and "umbrella" may be, you may not use them for a very long time, if ever, in another language. There's always time to learn them later when you're actively using the language.
*** You're more likely to have conversations with other people in a foreign language on subjects of interest to you. Why not learn a vocabulary for that subject? You can get by with very limited grammar. And having conversations with other real live people is an extremely productive activity for learning.
** It's easiest to learn words that are related to each other.
*** Aside from artificial associations (mnemonics), related words are rich in associations with each other. Remembering a couple words on a subject well can help you remember another half dozen with little additional effort.
* Theory
** anything should be able to link to anything else
** instead of thinking about a card, you can think of a starting point on the network or web
* PostgreSQL setup
** NEW: export PG_INITDB_OPTS="-A md5 -E UTF8 --pwprompt"
** OLD: export PG_INITDB_OPTS="-A md5 --locale=en_US.UTF8 --pwprompt"
** emerge -av dev-db/postgresql-server # 8.3.4 USE="pg-intdatetime"
** emerge --config =dev-db/postgresql-server-8.3.4
** /etc/init.d/postgresql-8.3 start
** M-x sql-postgres
*** user: postgres
*** database: postgres
*** host: localhost
** CREATE ROLE vocabulink WITH LOGIN ENCRYPTED PASSWORD '...';
** CREATE DATABASE vocabulink;
** GRANT ALL ON DATABASE vocabulink TO vocabulink;
** \c vocabulink postgres
** install pgcrypt (used for hashing passwords)
*** \i /usr/share/postgresql-8.3/contrib/pgcrypto.sql
** \c vocabulink vocabulink
* Ideas
** Reviews
*** via email or SMS at the exact time necessary for review (with excludable ranges)
** Link Sets
*** 100 most common words
** Use social rankings and rewards
*** for creating associations and mnemonics
*** for accumulating/reviewing words
** Reading Review
*** Search the internet for text that appears in your review stack for reading practice.
** Directed Links
Links should be either uni-directional or bi-directional, and represented as such with appropriate arrows (--> or <-->). A uni-directional link will only be reviewed or displayed in that orientation, a bi-directional link will show up as 2 review items.

Simple associations, those with no mnemonic information attached, are bi-directional by default, but can be switched to uni-directional. Mnemonic associations are uni-directional by default, if the mnemonic makes sense in both directions. Otherwise, for bi-directional associations, there needs to be 2 mnemonics. It's important that you never try to study an association in the reverse direction with a uni-directional mnemonic.

The most important associations you'll study are from foreign word -> native word. That will help your reading and listening comprehension. It is important to study native word -> foreign word or you will have a difficult time expressing yourself, but keep it simple in the beginning.

(There should be an option to automatically add a review item in the reverse direction with no mnemonic once the mnemonic direction has become sufficiently stable. But we need to measure the effects.)
** Words vs Lexemes
Internally, we refer to the "thing" on either side of the association as a "lexeme" (define lexeme). This is because we review characters as well as words.

Should we differentiate? Only time will tell, I think.

*** Interesting premise that verbs are the most important and should be learned first because a language is abstract.
1. 20,000 words -Beginner to advanced in one program No program gives you this many words, we give you the whole language. Most programs give you pet phrases about ordering at a resturant, but we teach you to actaully speak the language. No other program does this. Further, our the intial focus is learning verbs. Verbs are what you need to understand a language. A language is abstract and verb centered. Most programs start with nouns like farm animals and fruits. To understand a sentence you need verbs first, as this is the action and meaning of the sentence.

2. 50 Songs - What is the easiest, fastest and most painless way to learn a language? With music. We have created beautiful songs in a specific way connecting the rhythm of the language to the rhythm of music. The easiest and most effective way to learn a language is with music.

3. 3000 mnemonics - Have trouble remembering words, make words stick to your memory in a fun way with a memory system that goes back as far back as ancient Greece. The Ancient Greeks would remember entire epics by heart with mnemonics. It has been proven with the test of time for 3000 years as well as modern scientific studies.

4. Etymology- a true breakthrough - Our etymology does not just teach you the history of words but its purpose is to give you connections to English. This way you remember a word not as a foreign word but a word that is related to your own native language. This is the most effective mnemonic there is. Your target foreign word can goes into your brain not as a foreign word but as simply a variation of English, your native language! This is a true breakthrough in language learning and no other program teaches in this way.

5. Brainwaves - Have fun with this accelerated method of learning. We created specific brainwaves, delta-theta for deep learning.

6. Fairy-tales - Be a child again and read about courageous princes and beautiful princesses.

7. Storiesâ€“ Short interesting or funny stories that use the words you learned in context. Using your words in context is important.

8. Very practical conversation, Dialogues and the Socratic method - Learning key phrases and normal conversational situations will take you to a conversational level in your target language. But we use a form of the socratic method to draw make you think in the language.

We show you what is really important based on actual frequency of occurrence in conversation; therefore you will learn what is modern and even slang.

9. Grammar - Expressing complex things simply is the hallmark of creative effective design, this is what we have done with our grammar.

10. Native speakers - It puzzles me to this day why almost every program I have herd uses non-native speakers with foreign accents, or speak unrealistically quick and soft.  LearnFast use crisp, clear beautifully native speakers, who annunciate every syllable; when you are learning a language this is very important.
