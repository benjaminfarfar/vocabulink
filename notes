* Premises
AKA Why Should I Use Vocabulink?
** It's easiest to learn words for subjects you care about.
*** A network or related words helps you find words to learn that you care about. No more need to follow along with a textbook. The textbook may not teach you the word for "computer program".
*** As useful and general as "raincoat" and "umbrella" may be, you may not use them for a very long time, if ever, in another language. There's always time to learn them later when you're actively using the language.
*** You're more likely to have conversations with other people in a foreign language on subjects of interest to you. Why not learn a vocabulary for that subject? You can get by with very limited grammar. And having conversations with other real live people is an extremely productive activity for learning.
** It's easiest to learn words that are related to each other.
*** Aside from artificial associations (mnemonics), related words are rich in associations with each other. Remembering a couple words on a subject well can help you remember another half dozen with little additional effort.
* Theory
** anything should be able to link to anything else
** instead of thinking about a card, you can think of a starting point on the network or web
* PostgreSQL setup
** NEW: export PG_INITDB_OPTS="-A md5 -E UTF8 --pwprompt"
** OLD: export PG_INITDB_OPTS="-A md5 --locale=en_US.UTF8 --pwprompt"
** emerge -av dev-db/postgresql-server # 8.3.4 USE="pg-intdatetime"
** emerge --config =dev-db/postgresql-server-8.3.4
** /etc/init.d/postgresql-8.3 start
** M-x sql-postgres
*** user: postgres
*** database: postgres
*** host: localhost
** CREATE ROLE vocabulink WITH LOGIN ENCRYPTED PASSWORD '...';
** CREATE DATABASE vocabulink;
** GRANT ALL ON DATABASE vocabulink TO vocabulink;
** \c vocabulink postgres
