\chapter{Clients}

Currently Vocabulink supports only 1 type of client: a web browser.

\section{Encoding}

All pages are transmitted as UTF-8. This potentially excludes some number of
clients, but I'm not sure of the percentage yet. For now, if it's good enough
for Wikipedia, it's good enough for us.

\section{HTML}

We use XHTML rather than HTML. We're currently using the strict variant, but
note that Wikipedia uses transitional for some reason. It should be easy to
switch (even to HTML) if necessary in the future due to the use of a combinator
library.

\section{MIME Type}

For widest browser support, we transmit the content type as
\verb!text/html; charset=utf-8!.
