\chapter{Clients}

Currently Vocabulink supports only 1 type of client: a web browser.

\section{Encoding}

All pages are transmitted as UTF-8. This potentially excludes some number of
clients, but I'm not sure of the percentage yet. For now, if it's good enough
for Wikipedia, it's good enough for us.
