\section{Purpose}

Vocabulink's purpose is two-fold. First, it's a tool for assisting people in
learning a second language. Second, it's a research lab for studying language
learning. Each purpose serves the other. People learning with the help of the
site generate data for analysis. This analysis uncovers new understanding about
language learning which can then be fed back into Vocabulink. The improved
Vocabulink makes language learning easier, which leads to further data, etc.
