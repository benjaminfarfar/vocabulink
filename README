This is Vocabulink, the program that powers http://www.vocabulink.com/.

This source distribution consists mostly of a Haskell CGI application (located
in the cgi directory), but also contains the JavaScript, SQL, and CSS used by
the site as well. It contains almost everything you need to create a working
copy of Vocabulink. It does not include any database records or any other
content from the site. Such content is copyrighted by its respective owners and
has NOT been released to you under the GNU Affero Public license.

How to Build
============
cd cgi
make configure && make install

Note that you'll need GHC 7.0 or greater. Additionally, you'll need a modified
version haskell-src-meta that compiles on GHC 7.0 (I myself have just loosened
the requirements in haskell-src-meta's cabal file).
