** If you get stuck on coming up with a mnemonic for one word, try another. I keep a list of at least 10 mnemonics I'm working on at any given time. Sometimes I'll think of a good link word. Other times I'll think of a good story. Sometimes a word will sit for weeks and then a perfect link word and story will come to me in a flash.
** Announcement forum: new link editing, new previewing for link and comment bodies, as well as forum topics
** Announcement forum: new search means new way to create links (include note about new link hyperlink in the my links box)
** TODO: Add a "How to Learn a Link" section to the getting started article.
** Write an article about the vision of Vocabulink.
*** Inspire people to write mnemonics.
*** Show them it's a long-term thing.
*** Explain how rewarding it can be to have your learning tool used by others.
*** Talk about the marketplace idea.
*** Talk about how it will be used for research into improving the method and language learning in general.
** Make a FAQ
*** How many words actually work with this technique?
We won't know until we try. Based on experience, I expect that the majority of the most common words of a language will have link words. For the rest, I hope we can explore other mnemonic techniques such as relationship associations.
** Add a list of browsers the site is tested with.
** Clean up the "How to Write a Memorable Mnemonic" page <- gets a lot of search traffic
** It helps to have a list of mnemonics that you're working on. If you can't come up with either a link word or mnemonic after 5 minutes, try another. There are plenty of words out there. Maybe tomorrow or the next day a mnemonic will come to mind immediately. That's how it works for me.
** Explain that a really good mnemonic, especially for prepositions or other words that don't translate perfectly, use the story to illustrate how the word is used in the foreign language, especially if we use multiple English words for the same meaning.
** Write about how I use a dictionary to make sure that my link word won't conflict with other words, or at least not with other common words.
** Talk about really using your imagination and putting yourself into each story while reading it.
** Add to FAQ how to work with RTL text.
   - Basically, can't use Firefox. Try Safari or Chrome instead.
   - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=311545
** Add to the article about creating links how to use *italic* for the link word and **bold** for the meaning.
** Explain that you want to go from your target language to your native language when creating links.
** Q. How do you chose which form to use with Esperanto words (since they can be a noun, verb, adjective, etc.) A. Use the most common form. This can be determined by word frequency lists or if you don't have any other way of determining it, you can use the dictionary form (although it might not be the most common).
** The 3 components of learning a language
1. Vocabulary
2. Immersion
3. Grammar/Logic

Textbooks deal with all 3 at once. Problems with textbooks: 1-size-fits-all approach, approaching subjects in logical groups (leads to waste, no need to learn all the items in a supermarket or all the colors).

Vocabulary is a universal language-learning activity. The method of immersion is very individual. That's why the immersion practice in a textbook seems so contrived and artificial: it was cooked up by a group of authors or at best a single author whose idea of immersion is probably radically different from yours.

Grammer study is also rather individual. Some people like to study the history and evolution of a language. Others like to study grammar formally. Some like to pick up grammar through immersion (making mistakes).
** How to get started learning another language.
** Why only link to the Hiragana/Katakana spelling of a word? Why not the Kanji or romaji, or some combination?
First of all, learn to understand Japanese words and sentences before you worry about the Kanji. I made that mistake myself. I put in a massive effort to learn how to write and pronounce the Kanji using James Hesig's books, long before I needed to. I thought it would be cool and "proper". In the end, much of it was wasted effort.

It's important that you are able to practice reading Japanese, but there are plenty basic level Japanese readers out there that use either only hiragana or furigana (hiragana above/below? the Kanji). Even once you outgrow those, you can use programs on your computer that will convert the Kanji into readable hiragana for you.

Proceeding this way will enable you to learn Kanji in context from your reading. Yes, at some point you will need to undertake disciplined study of the Kanji if you want to read and write at a high level, but why discourage yourself now and take away time from learning vocabulary?

As for romaji, many will agree that romaji is a crutch which will lead to bad pronunciation habits. With only 46? hiragana, it won't take long to learn them and get used to them as well as the roman alphabet.

Also, we want to apply the minimum information principle. As strange as it sounds, having both the hiragana and the romaji (let alone the Kanji) in your review actually makes things more difficult. Even though it's helpful information, your brain is trying to encode more at a time. If you know you only have to worry about hiragana (or katakana with imported words), some work is lifted from your brain.

If you do want to start studying the Kanji representation of words, go ahead and create a link from the hiragana version to the Kanji version. This allows you to practice directly in Japanese, maintains the minimum information principle, and allows you to employ another mnemonic for its study (one not based on sound but on Kanji meaning or appearance).
** Why we review links (associations) and not words. (There are few direct correlations between foreign words except for concrete nouns).
  [[file:~/project/vocabulink/vocabulink.cgi/vocabulink.sql::]]
** How to Create Memorable Mnemonics
** How to Evaluate/Rate Mnemonics
** Why only words and symbols? Why not grammar and sentences?
Because grammar and sentences are much harder to memorize, but much easier to learn with enough vocabulary.
Latin-based grammar study does not work. If you need to memorize verb forms, use associative links (jump -> jumped is to 躍り出る -> ?). If you need to memorize irregular verbs, use associative links with mnemonics.
Once you learn enough vocabulary, you'll be able to infer grammar rules from your reading and listening practice. The point of vocabulink is not to make you a fluent, it's to get you to the point where becoming fluent is fun and natural with enough interaction in the language.

** Reviews
*** via email or SMS at the exact time necessary for review (with excludable ranges)
** Link Sets
*** 100 most common words
** Use social rankings and rewards
*** for creating associations and mnemonics
*** for accumulating/reviewing words
** Reading Review
*** Search the internet for text that appears in your review stack for reading practice.
** Directed Links
Links should be either uni-directional or bi-directional, and represented as such with appropriate arrows (--> or <-->). A uni-directional link will only be reviewed or displayed in that orientation, a bi-directional link will show up as 2 review items.

Simple associations, those with no mnemonic information attached, are bi-directional by default, but can be switched to uni-directional. Mnemonic associations are uni-directional by default, if the mnemonic makes sense in both directions. Otherwise, for bi-directional associations, there needs to be 2 mnemonics. It's important that you never try to study an association in the reverse direction with a uni-directional mnemonic.

The most important associations you'll study are from foreign word -> native word. That will help your reading and listening comprehension. It is important to study native word -> foreign word or you will have a difficult time expressing yourself, but keep it simple in the beginning.

(There should be an option to automatically add a review item in the reverse direction with no mnemonic once the mnemonic direction has become sufficiently stable. But we need to measure the effects.)
** Words vs Lexemes
Internally, we refer to the "thing" on either side of the association as a "lexeme" (define lexeme). This is because we review characters as well as words.

Should we differentiate? Only time will tell, I think.

** Research the comment-on-anything frameworks out there.
** Apply game mechanics to the process of using Vocabulink http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihUt-163gZI
*** collections
*** points/levels

**** During review, good feedback for good results
**** How they've been doing lately at the end of their review
**** Allow them to exit the review early and get results
*** exchanges
*** customization
And for objects:
*** accessible (both easy to use and Open API)
*** recombinant data objects (sets is just 1 way)
*** syndicatable (can people publish their collections on another site)
Direct and shape creation:
*** spotlight and feature the best links (regularly, think Daily Deviations)
** Add hints about keyboard shortcuts to the review page is some gradual and dismissable way.
** Add a "Don't forget to confirm your email address" to the front page for new unconfirmed members.
** Check possibility of a PostgreSQL view for retrieving links.
   - automatically do language joins
   - automatically exclude deleted links
** See if using views can simplify the code, especially with Link Types.
** Move static files to a CDN.
   - cachefly.com?

[Wed May  6 2009]
<shachaf> Good $TIME. :-)  [22:24]
<jekor> Hi ;)
<shachaf> So I'm trying to add a link to figure things out.  [22:25]
<shachaf> In this case, kiitos (Finnish), which is "thank you" in English
          (pronounced "key toss", so it works out pretty nicely).
<jekor> OK  [22:26]
<shachaf> Should I just have it linked to "thank you"? Or "thanks", or
          something else?
<jekor> Hmm...either one works. There's no definitive form to use. As long as
        you get the proper meaning, it should be fine.  [22:27]
<shachaf> Is there a particular recommended system (I just posted in Help
          about this) for bold/italic text?
<jekor> I would use "thank you" personally.
<jekor> Ah. That's a good question.
<jekor> What I do personally is italicize the link word (*key toss*) and bold
        the meaning (**thank you**). But there's no theory or scientific
        reasoning behind it.  [22:28]
<shachaf> It's what I like also ("thanks" seems too casual), but I'm imagining
          languages where "thank you" are two separate words.
<jekor> Yes. I think maybe once the database has a lot more pairs than maybe
        being more formal will become important.
<shachaf> Well, the bold/italic was quite helpful for me (I wonder if it's
          possible to do it automatically?).
<jekor> Hmm...that's a good question.  [22:29]
<jekor> The only challenge would be catching the different forms of certain
        words and when they're part of compound words.
<jekor> Perhaps there could be some sort of hinting system that makes
        suggestions when you're creating a link.
<jekor> But, I think that's down my list of priorities :)
<shachaf> Markdown doesn't have some simple way to mark words for something
          like this, does it?  [22:30]
<jekor> I'm planning on making a feature voting system so that I can work on
        things based on what everyone studying wants.
<shachaf> Sure, of course.
<jekor> Yes. Those asterisks I was showing, if I understand your question.
<jekor> *italic* **bold**
<shachaf> OK, so I'll stick with *i* and **b**.
<jekor> :)
<shachaf> Should I refrain from adding Hebrew until RTL is figured out?
<shachaf> I suppose it's just a display thing.  [22:31]
<jekor> You can always try. But no guarantees that it'll come out right when I
        implement RTL :)
<jekor> Do you know of any RTL resources? I've never worked with RTL languages
        before.
<jekor> Specifically for HTML?  [22:32]
<jekor> If not, no worries, I'm sure I'll be able to find some information.
<shachaf> Well, HTML does it pretty well on its own, now that I looked more
          carefully.
<shachaf> The main problem is the image that's generated by the Javascript.
<shachaf> (I think.)
<jekor> Ah...
<jekor> I'll have to talk to the guy who wrote that JavaScript library then.
                                                                        [22:33]
<jekor> It generates SVG which might be not as well supported.
<shachaf> So I would have Foreign: "kiitos", Native: "thank you", Link Word:
          "key toss"?
<jekor> If the HTML is OK, I suspect that the link will go into the database
        correctly. And then I can just work on the JavaScript display and it
        should get fixed.
<jekor> Perfect.
<shachaf> In "stories"/"links", are you for or against (or neither) mentioning
          the language/country/something related to that in the story?  [22:35]
<shachaf> I see that <http://www.vocabulink.com/link/4> mentions Japan,
          actually, so it should be fine?  [22:36]
<jekor> Hmmm...that might be helpful if you're planning to learn multiple
        languages and don't want to jumble them up. But I'm not sure if it's
        worth the extra effort. I mean, if the story lends itself naturally to
        that, I think it's good.
<jekor> As long as it doesn't introduce ambiguity.
<jekor> Yes.
<jekor> Yeah. I forgot that I've been sort of doing that.  [22:37]
<jekor> I'm not doing it for any specific reason other than that I think
        people who are studying Japanese might be more interested in a story
        that relates to Japan somehow (and hence more likely to remember it).
<shachaf> Might this be helpful for SVG?
          http://www.w3.org/International/tutorials/svg-tiny-bidi/  [22:38]
<jekor> Yes, I think so. If the JavaScript library maintainers don't have a
        solution I think that that will definitely be helpful.  [22:39]
<shachaf> I'm not sure how the Javascript (or SVG, for that matter) works, but
          it might be relevant.
<jekor> Very cool. This has been a very helpful conversation for me :) It's
        too easy to assume things when you've been working on something for
        this long. You're helping me get this stuff out of my head and on to
        paper, so to speak.  [22:40]
<jekor> Thanks.
<shachaf> There's no particular preference for first-person/third-person or
          anything like that in stories, is there?
<jekor> Nope. I've just been trying to vary them up.
<jekor> Although, these are all good questions.
<shachaf> Sure -- I hope this becomes a helpful language-learning resource.
          :-)  [22:41]
<jekor> And it's something that I'm hoping the site will help answer. It may
        be possible with enough data on reviews and such to figure out this
        sort of thing statistically.
<jekor> How long have you been studying Hebrew and Finnish?  [22:42]
<shachaf> There *is* a preference for repeating both source and target
          (origin/destination? foreign/native?) several times in the story,
          yes?
<jekor> And do you think an IRC channel would be useful?  [22:43]
<jekor> Absolutely. I think it helps.
<shachaf> I was born in Israel and speak Hebrew natively (I guess that's the
          word?).
<jekor> Ah. You speak English very fluently. I thought you were a native
        English speaker :)
<shachaf> Well, the story is a bit odd with that.  [22:44]
<jekor> Regarding repeatition, I think it's useful to help the reader really
        remember the important words in the story. I've found that it's easy
        with short stories to accidentally remember the wrong meaning.
<shachaf> (I'm told:) I learned English first, but then consciously decided to
          forget it and speak only Hebrew when I was ~three. I relearned it
          pretty quickly when I moved to the US when I was ~ten.  [22:45]
<jekor> The most critical seems to be the meaning. Repeating the foreign word
        and the link word I don't think is quite as important. After all, the
        link word is meant to remind you of the meaning of the word when you
        hear/read the foreign word.
<jekor> Hahaha. That's interesting.
<shachaf> Some of my family is Finnish, and I was there in the summer, but
          haven't really studied the language.  [22:46]
<shachaf> If I turn out to be eligible for Finnish citizenship (I'm not sure
          how it works at this point), it seems to make sense that I'd speak
          the language. :-)
<jekor> That would make sense ;)
<shachaf> (How is your nick pronounced?)  [22:48]
<shachaf> A general question: Is this mainly for nouns, or
          nouns/verbs/adverbs, or what?  [22:49]
<jekor> However you like. Either yay-core (Esperanto pronunciation and how I
        pronounce it) or jay-core, but some friends pronounce it jeh-core. I
        answer to them all :)
<jekor> Good question!
<shachaf> I assume words like "the" shouldn't really be part of this.  [22:50]
<jekor> Nouns are certainly the easiest to use stories for because they're so
        concrete. But I think that particles are extremely important (and
        difficult) to learn, and that's why I have so many simple Japanese
        words.
<jekor> It depends.
<shachaf> Isn't the Esperanto pronunciation yeh-core?
<shachaf> (Isn't it "e" as in "send"?)
<jekor> That's probably a more correct spelling of the pronunciation.
<jekor> Not quite, I don't think.  [22:51]
<shachaf> Particles are words as in "the"?  [22:52]
<jekor> I think it's a slightly longer a sound. But I haven't spoken Esperanto
        in about 5 years.
<jekor> Well...regarding "the"...
<shachaf> I think those vary across languages even more than nouns.
<shachaf> s/as in/like/
<jekor> I think it's considered a particle, but it's such a common one that
        it's probably not worth making a story for because anyone interested
        in the language probably already knows it.
<jekor> But other words such as "of" "through" "in" and such, I think stories
        are useful for those.  [22:53]
<jekor> Yes. They are definitely a challenge.
<jekor> I don't worry about getting the meaning perfect. I suspect that you
        only really learn the proper meaning for such words through usage.
<jekor> But it doesn't hurt to have a good story to give you a head start.
<shachaf> What about ones that don't exist in English? Like "את" (et) in
          Hebrew?  [22:54]
<shachaf> Wiktionary says "Used to introduce a semantically definite direct
          object.", which doesn't mean much to me. :-)
<jekor> For example, I wouldn't try to create stories for "は" or "が" because
        they're just too nuanced.
<jekor> Heh. That's a good question. I haven't really dealt with the challenge
        yet.
<jekor> I figure it's easier to put off ones like that until I've tackled all
        of the easier words first! Heh.  [22:55]
<shachaf> It's always annoying to try to translate it to English, because it
          just doesn't exist (though it feels like it almost does/should).
<shachaf> Sorry, I can't read Japanese. :_)
<jekor> No problem.
<shachaf> Though it's on my list of languages-I'd-like-to-look-into-someday.
<jekor> Basically, those are similar. They really don't have a good English
        equivalent.
<jekor> They're the types of words that people write entire an entire chapter
        of a book about :)  [22:56]
<shachaf> I know very little about it (I did a bit of Aikido at one point, but
          that involved minimal amounts of the language).
<jekor> Ah! Aikido. I did a little bit too. Seems we have kindred spirits.
<shachaf> Hmm, you are also in WA? At least your IRC client is.  [22:58]
<jekor> You know, I'd be very interested in working with you on creating
        mnemonics in the future. You seem to get it a lot more than the people
        who have joined the site so far (no offense to them, you just seem to
        be more experienced with language and learning).
<jekor> Strange. I'm not, but I'm in Northern California. Maybe that was the
        closest server :)
<jekor> By the way, I intend to make the site more of a vocabulary-learning
        marketplace over the coming months.  [22:59]
<shachaf> s/experienced with/interested in/, perhaps. :-)
<jekor> I'd like for people to be able to create and sell their links to
        others for study. It seems like the only way to encourage really
        high-quality mnemonics.
<jekor> Sometimes the interest is more important than and will lead to the
        experience ;)
<jekor> I think it will be especially important if we want to really make
        memorable links using illustrations and such.  [23:00]
<jekor> The free functions and the ability for anyone to create links will
        always be there though.
<shachaf> By the way, when a person makes a link, it doesn't seem like their
          username is shown with it (as far as I can see). Should it be?
<jekor> Yes. It should. I'd also like to show other metadata like when it was
        created. Also, I'd like to allow people to comment on and rate links.
                                                                        [23:01]
<jekor> You know, all of the social-networking type of stuff.
<jekor> Just need to spend the time to do so :)
<shachaf> I feel like I've been asking questions about the "small things"
          rather a lot, by the way, because the "big things" felt too big to
          ask in one question. :-)  [23:02]
<jekor> No worries. That seems to be the only way to tackle the big things.
<shachaf> Such as: Is this method of learning languages actually effective?
<jekor> Hah! :)
<jekor> In my experience, it is. And from direct experience with others, it is
        as well.
<jekor> Time will tell as I analyze the review statistics.
<shachaf> Really, I'm not sure. I'm willing to go along with it for at least a
          while to see if it is.  [23:03]
<jekor> (The site is half about helping people learn language and half about
        researching how people learn language.)
<shachaf> So you've done this sort of thing in other contexts?
<jekor> Yes. I used it for both Japanese and Esperanto. And I became fluent in
        Esperanto with the help of it.
<jekor> I think there's a bigger question.
<shachaf> What about words that don't have easy mnemonics?
<jekor> There's no doubt in my mind that the mnemonics help with language
        learning. I've used all sorts of mnemonics for language learning in
        the past. The bigger question is:  [23:04]
<jekor> Is it worth the time investment?
<jekor> I think that for individuals having to create their own stories, it's
        probably not an effective use of time.
<shachaf> Of reading the full stories, you mean? Or writing them?
<jekor> Because really good mnemonics can take up to 30 minutes to create.
<jekor> Creating them.
<jekor> Yes. That's the whole point behind the site. Reading the mnemonics is
        certainly worth the time.
<jekor> It's much better than drilling the two words over and over.  [23:05]
<shachaf> מים (bah, no RTL support in this IRC client) happens to be
          pronounced like "mime", so it works. But my initial feeling (I might
          be wrong!) is that most words wouldn't correspond that nicely.
<jekor> Anyway, the site is about leveraging specialization.
<jekor> Hmm...this would be so much easier to have a conversation via voice.
        Do you have Skype?
<jekor> Although, IRC is good too because then I have a log for putting this
        all into an article.
<jekor> There are so many things to say on this topic.  [23:06]
<jekor> I've had conversations about this in my head for many hours. But my
        wife is sick of hearing about it :)
<jekor> First of all, only time will tell. Second, I think that most words
        will actually fit the link word method with enough effort.
<shachaf> I do have Skype (though I almost never use it), but I would be
          worried about talking and waking people up at the moment, and I'd
          need to work on setting up my microphone.  [23:07]
<jekor> I've been going through a word frequency list for the Japanese
        mnemonics. Not all of them were easy or obvious at first.
<jekor> And I've had a lot of experience doing this already.
<shachaf> What was the Esperanto resource with all the mnemonics that you
          used?
<jekor> Don't worry about it. Maybe some other day. Like I said, it's nice to
        have someone interested in this to talk ideas out with.
<jekor> The Esperanto ones were my own. I only published some of them, and I
        think I lost them.  [23:08]
<jekor> They were not as detailed or refined as the ones I've been creating on
        Vocabulink though.
<shachaf> Are stories always to be written in the "Native" language?
<shachaf> So if you have English->Japanese, the story would be in Japanese?
                                                                        [23:09]
<jekor> But back to the point. If not everyone has to create their own
        mnemonics and language learners can benefit from stories created by
        other people, I definitely think it will be a more effective way to
        learn language. I have no doubts. The challenge is building up enough
        mnemonics. And that's why I think there needs to be a financial
        incentive.
<jekor> There will be a handful of people who are really good at creating
        excellent memorable stories, and if they are compensated and motivated
        to do so, everyone will benefit.  [23:10]
<jekor> No, they don't I don't think.
<jekor> In fact, I have personally used link words that were not in my native
        language.
<shachaf> So is this site English-centric?
<shachaf> By Native I mean Target/Destination/Right-side-of-the-arrow.
<jekor> I haven't put any on the site because I'm trying to focus only on ones
        that will be generally useful to everyone, at least until there are a
        lot more links up there.
<jekor> Oh.
<shachaf> What is the right term for that?  [23:11]
<jekor> I think it's a good idea to do so, yes. If only because it will be
        useful to far fewer people if you are using 2 languages.
<shachaf> Er, what?
 * shachaf is confused.
<jekor> The site is English-centric in as much as the interface is currently
        in English.
<shachaf> What would be?
<jekor> OK, sorry. I'll slow down and back up.  [23:12]
<shachaf> I mean 06:11 <jekor> I think it's a good idea to do so, yes. If only
          because it will be useful to far fewer people if you are using 2
          languages.
<shachaf> What would be useful to far fewer people?
<jekor> So, I think it's fine to have, say, Finnish -> Hebrew where you were
        learning a Finnish word with a Hebrew link word and story.
<shachaf> OK, that's what I meant.  [23:13]
<jekor> But I think that Finnish -> Hebrew with an English link word and
        Hebrew story would be less useful to others. It could be great for you
        though.
<jekor> Yes, in that respect the site is not English-centric. And I hope at
        some point to translate the interface into other languages as well.
<shachaf> That doesn't seem to make much sense in general. I'd think the word
          should match the story.
<jekor> I just happen to create all links with English on the right side
        ("destination") because I'm targetting English-speaking learners
        first. I want to build a critical mass in a couple languages for
        English learners before branching out. But that's just me personally.
                                                                        [23:14]
<jekor> I have however used Japanese -> English with a Japanese link word and
        an English story.
<jekor> But I didn't put any like that on the site because they require
        someone to know that link word. Maybe I'll create some sort of
        dependency for that one day.  [23:15]
<shachaf> "Avoid making up words when you're searching for a link word." --
          how strict is this?
<jekor> Also, I've been experimenting with other link types other than
        stories, but that's a whole other topic :)
<jekor> Well, if it's your last resort, it's fine. But I've found that I tend
        to forget the link word in those cases.
<jekor> I'm trying to remember an example.  [23:16]
<jekor> Oh, here's one:
<jekor> けいたい (keitai "kay-tie")
<shachaf> Oh, a small issue of time zone: We're both in Pacific time, but the
          forum is showing something else. It's slightly confusing -- perhaps
          something can be done about it?
<jekor> It would be tempting to make up something like K-tie (a K-shaped tie),
        and it might even work. But I'll look for something else first.
<jekor> Yes. I have a plan for that as well. It's displaying times in UTC
        right now I think. I want to have it display times in your time zone,
        but that's going to require some more code.  [23:17]
<jekor> But thanks for pointing it out.
<jekor> Oh, on the subject of "do all words work for this". The link word
        doesn't have to be exact.
<shachaf> How about "Kate, I--"? (Where someone keeps being interrupted).
          Would the glottal stop (it's called a glottal stop, right?) be a
          problem?
<jekor> That might work. I still wouldn't be totally satisfied with that one
        since I'd have a hard time weaving it into a story. But it would work.
        I'm not sure which would be better in this case "K-tie" or "Kate,
        I--". It depends on what kind of story you could come up with.  [23:18]
<shachaf> Or "Kate Eye". But I'd have a hard time thinking of anything else.
                                                                        [23:19]
<jekor> But you could search for a 2-word phrase that just starts with those
        sounds. I'm trying to come up with one right now.
<shachaf> Is the source in a darcs repository or something, by the way? Or
          just tarballs?
<jekor> (It sometimes takes me 5-10 minutes or longer to find a good link
        word.)
<jekor> I have a darcs repository. But I need to clean it up. It has some old
        passwords and stuff in it that I need to get rid of before I publish
        it.  [23:20]
<jekor> So I take it you're a Haskeller?
<jekor> Kate Eye is getting better.
<shachaf> Yes, I came to the page through programming.reddit (I think).
<jekor> I love reddit.
<jekor> I waste way too much time on there.
<shachaf> Same here, sadly enough.  [23:21]
<jekor> Well, in this case, I would probably end up settling on one of those 3
        phrases as a link word.
<jekor> But maybe someone else would come along later with a better mnemonic
        :)
<shachaf> By the way, I know very little about how Japanese is written.
                                                                        [23:22]
<shachaf> But it's not phonetic, is it?
<jekor> It is actually. It makes learning very easy.
<jekor> Well...
<jekor> The Kanji (borrowed Chinese characters) are not.
<jekor> But too many Japanese learners get too tied up on the Kanji.
<jekor> That's why all of the links are using hiragana (the phonetic script).
                                                                        [23:23]
<jekor> I myself made that mistake.
<jekor> (I'm planning to write an article about learning Japanese as well.)
<shachaf> I imagine Chinese and other non-phonetic languages could be a bit of
          trouble here.
<jekor> I spent months studying the Kanji, but it was mostly wasted time.
                                                                        [23:24]
<shachaf> Especially Chinese with the different spoken dialects.
<jekor> Perhaps. But I've studied some Chinese as well. I think the solution
        will be to use pinyin.
<jekor> So, with both of them I would try to separate out the learning of
        (spoken) vocabulary with learning the complex writing system.  [23:25]
<jekor> Nowadays there are programs that will convert web pages into the
        phoneticized script for tohse languages.
<jekor> So you can learn the writing system as you go naturally while you read
        websites you're interested in. I think that's a better solution than
        torturing yourself with drilling the chinese characters.
<shachaf> I'm reminded of something written by Tim Ferriss (that I only came
          across recently?) where he recommends not using Pinyin (I think?).
                                                                        [23:26]
<shachaf> But another romanization.  [23:27]
<shachaf> Probably this is getting too off-topic. :-)
<jekor> I will look that up.
<jekor> I think that as long as the writing system doesn't lead to
        mispronunciation habits, it would be OK.
<jekor> That's why I'm not using romanized Japanese.
<jekor> No worries. I love discussing this sort of thing.  [23:28]
<shachaf> Did you read what he said about learning languages? The talk on TED
          was interesting but not very complete. I should look it up.
<jekor> I think I might create a vocabulink IRC channel. Unless you know of
        any good language learning channels that already exist.
<jekor> Oh. I think I saw that one. The one about swimming, language, and
        dancing?
<shachaf> Yes.
<jekor> I wish he would have gone into a little bit more detail on his method.
        I'll need to read his blog.  [23:29]
<jekor> But I gather that he approaches it somewhat scientifically.
<jekor> I.e. here are the words and grammatical rules I'm going to really need
        to know
<shachaf> I would hardly be the person to ask about language-learning. :-) I'd
          expect specific channels (like learning Japanese or Esperanto),
          maybe, but not so much languages in general, and certainly not on
          Freenode.
<jekor> I haven't been on any other IRC networks in years... Freenode is so
        stable :)  [23:30]

<jekor> Yep!
<jekor> I found that I spent so much time in programming language debate.
                                                                        [23:32]
<jekor> And that really, I was learning more by just writing code.
<jekor> Now I have even less time because I work a 9-5 writing code for
        another website.
<jekor> So there's hardly any time for Vocabulink, let alone anything else.
<shachaf> I've been much less active in #haskell too for some time, actually.
          It's a surprising amount of effort to be a "regular" -- juggling
          conversations, reading what everyone is saying.  [23:33]
<jekor> Although I owe IRC for introducing me to Haskell about 10 years ago. I
        wish I would have picked it up then, though.
<jekor> Yeah. I think it was much easier to be on IRC when 1) the web was much
        smaller and 2) I didn't have a full-time job and a wife :)  [23:34]
<jekor> Now the mailing lists are so active, there's activity on the wiki,
        there's tons of Haskell blogs...
<jekor> I do ask questions in #haskell every once in a while though because
        I'm generally too impatient to wait for a response on a mailing list
        :D  [23:35]
<jekor> But the guilt of having such a 1-way relationship with #haskell will
        probably catch up with me eventually.
<shachaf> 22:08 <lambdabot> I saw jekor leaving #haskell 5m 10d 3h 40m 43s
          ago, and .
<jekor> !  [23:36]
<jekor> Not sure when that's counting from.
<shachaf> Can there be multiple links between the same words, by the way?
                                                                        [23:37]
<jekor> Yes. That was my intention from the beginning. I don't know how long
        it's going to take to get there.
<jekor> The idea is that the "link graph" you see when you search for a link
        can have a bunch of branches.  [23:38]
<shachaf> I mean as in multiple paths from "kiitos" to "thank you".
<jekor> There's no duplicate checking either. And the reason goes back to the
        idea of creating and selling the links in packs. I don't want someone
        to be blocked from creating a link by someone else.  [23:39]
<jekor> (Even though it doesn't make sense to have 2 duplicate cognate links,
        for instance. But that's just something I'm procrastinating on finding
        a really good solution for.)
<jekor> But yes, you can have multiple ways to do it.
<jekor> Different people could have different links, and they could get
        voted/rated differently where one would win out.  [23:40]
<shachaf> OK.
<shachaf> You said there would be editing in one form or another eventually?
<jekor> Yes.  [23:41]
<jekor> Sooner rather than later.
<jekor> Anyway, I've got to get bed. But thanks for your questions and
        interest. It has helped me focus and prioritize my todo list and given
        my ideas for how to make the site more intuitive ;)
<jekor> s/my ideas/me ideas/  [23:42]
<shachaf> I'm wary about adding links that I can't edit later; I'm a bit of a
          perfectionist sometimes. :-) Though that doesn't help much when
          writing "stories" of any kind.
<jekor> Me too. I totally understand.
<shachaf> OK, glad I could help. I should go to bed too.
<jekor> Kaizen is the only thing that gets me over my perfectionism.
<jekor> Later!
<shachaf> Bonan nokton. :-)
<jekor> :D ! Bonan nokton, al vi ankaux!

*** Interesting premise that verbs are the most important and should be learned first because a language is abstract.
1. 20,000 words -Beginner to advanced in one program No program gives you this many words, we give you the whole language. Most programs give you pet phrases about ordering at a resturant, but we teach you to actaully speak the language. No other program does this. Further, our the intial focus is learning verbs. Verbs are what you need to understand a language. A language is abstract and verb centered. Most programs start with nouns like farm animals and fruits. To understand a sentence you need verbs first, as this is the action and meaning of the sentence.

2. 50 Songs - What is the easiest, fastest and most painless way to learn a language? With music. We have created beautiful songs in a specific way connecting the rhythm of the language to the rhythm of music. The easiest and most effective way to learn a language is with music.

3. 3000 mnemonics - Have trouble remembering words, make words stick to your memory in a fun way with a memory system that goes back as far back as ancient Greece. The Ancient Greeks would remember entire epics by heart with mnemonics. It has been proven with the test of time for 3000 years as well as modern scientific studies.

4. Etymology- a true breakthrough - Our etymology does not just teach you the history of words but its purpose is to give you connections to English. This way you remember a word not as a foreign word but a word that is related to your own native language. This is the most effective mnemonic there is. Your target foreign word can goes into your brain not as a foreign word but as simply a variation of English, your native language! This is a true breakthrough in language learning and no other program teaches in this way.

5. Brainwaves - Have fun with this accelerated method of learning. We created specific brainwaves, delta-theta for deep learning.

6. Fairy-tales - Be a child again and read about courageous princes and beautiful princesses.

7. Stories– Short interesting or funny stories that use the words you learned in context. Using your words in context is important.

8. Very practical conversation, Dialogues and the Socratic method - Learning key phrases and normal conversational situations will take you to a conversational level in your target language. But we use a form of the socratic method to draw make you think in the language.

We show you what is really important based on actual frequency of occurrence in conversation; therefore you will learn what is modern and even slang.

9. Grammar - Expressing complex things simply is the hallmark of creative effective design, this is what we have done with our grammar.

10. Native speakers - It puzzles me to this day why almost every program I have herd uses non-native speakers with foreign accents, or speak unrealistically quick and soft.  LearnFast use crisp, clear beautifully native speakers, who annunciate every syllable; when you are learning a language this is very important.

Kanji-lish 1.0
Kanjilish is a Firefox add-on that allows you to practice Japanese kanji while you read English (or other languages). It helps you learn the meaning of kanji. Since you have to read sometimes in your native language, you might as well practice kanji while you do it. What the program does is simple. It replaces the first letter of a word with a kanji of similar meaning. For example, the word read might appear as )

** How to Write Mnemonics for Other People

*** General Mnemonics Should Be Based on Shared Experience

When inventing mnemonics for your own personal use, you can draw on your vast personal experience. You might be able to tie words to people you know, places you've visited, or experiences you've had. Sometimes these personal mnemonics are extremely effective, because you already have deep associations with these existing memories.

But in order to make your mnemonics effective for others, they should be based on shared experience.

If your mnemonic is based on personal experience, share it!

Perhaps you'd like to create a mnemonic based on a movie you know well. You can't expect for a significant percentage of learners to have seen the same movie. There's no need to throw out the idea of using the movie. You can explain briefly the concept of the movie and how it applies to the mnemonic you're creating.
** Mnemonic Templates

Here are some templates to get you started or inspire you to write your own mnemonics.

(Link to examples of each.)

*** The Story

The story is the most common mnemonic type on Vocabulink.

First-person, third-person, and even second-person voices work well (although the second-person voice is more common for the following templates).

(ni, 67)

*** Philosophy

It's somewhat rare to get a chance to use a link word and definition together to preach your philosophy. But when it happens, take the opportunity. The mnemonic might not resonate with everyone, but it gives you a chance to speak out on an issue while helping others to learn language. Someone else can always write a story for the word later.

The challenge is to keep your rant on-topic. (Interestingly, this is probably also a challenge for all philosophical writing.)

Don't worry if the topic of your rant is controversial. The more controversial, the more charged with emotion, the more memorable it is.

(devi, 96)
(nur, 65)

*** Thought Experiments

Invite

(duo, 103)

*** Entomology

Though rare, sometimes the story of a word's origin is interesting and colorful enough.

** Japanese Mnemonics

*** Why Use Hiragana? Why Not Kanji or Romaji?

programs to produce hiragana for kanji automatically, bad habits with romaji, don't want to get distracted by learning kanji which can come later better to start communicating now

how much time I wasted with kanji

good news though, kanji are easy to learn later with Heisig's method, but once you get past volume 1 you're going to need to have a solid vocabulary to proceed. If you don't have a solid vocabulary, you will have learned how to write a number of kanji, but you won't be able to use them, and then you'll begin to forget

Using hiragana also disambiguates Kanji. When reviewing 人, is it ひと (person), じん (type of person), にん (counter for people), etc?

You can still use mnemonics and spaced repetition for learning the Kanji. This breaks apart the process and leads to less confusion.

** Misc

Instructors confuse simple words with common words. Concepts that you learn at a young age might be simple and easy to grasp, but that does not mean that they'll be useful.

Examples: colors, furniture, parts of clothing, body parts, animals

We have to view vocabulary as a scarce resource. Each word takes time to learn and review. If it's not useful in practical (vs contrived) exercises, it should be left as something to learn once basic conversational skill/fluency is achieved.

The useful words are the abstract ones. The ones that are difficult to draw a picture for in a text book.
* Mnemonics
** Make a new mnemonic type for lauxdi -> laudible?
** audiaux -> adieu (Fr?) sound-alike
** audiaux -> adios (Sp?) sound-alike=
** ja -> jaweh (sp?) God of War
