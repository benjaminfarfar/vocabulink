          Outrageous Stories

        %p Vocabulink uses imaginative stories to make new words stick. This use of stories is a language-learning technique called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linkword">Linkword mnemonics</a>.

        %p Your memory is especially receptive to stories. We pass our history down from generation to generation through stories. We teach lessons to children with stories. Experienced speakers knows that stories are essential for getting a point across and making it stick with an audience.

        %p Vocabulink exploits this unique feature of the human brain to make learning more natural. It may seem silly at first, but it's effective.

        Important Words

      %p The <a href="http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/page/93">Oxford English Dictionary</a> defines 171,476 words currently in use. That seems like a daunting amount until you realize that the word "the" makes up 7% of the total words we read. Next, the word "of" accounts for 3.5%, "and" makes up another 2.8%, and so on. You only need to know about 135 words to recognize half the words in common written English.

      %p This uneven spread is similar in every language that statisticians have studied. In fact, it has a name: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law">Zipf's law</a>. We can take advantage of this law in order to build vocabulary scientifically. You can use your study time more effectively by ignoring words that you'll rarely, if ever, use.

        Spaced Repetition

      %p Sometimes we forget words, even when we've used memorable stories. But it's a tedious waste of time to keep studying the same words day after day.

      %p The traditional solution to this is flashcards. But there's a better way.

      %p We've taken some of the latest scientific research about how memory works and made it an integrated part of Vocabulink. It's called <a href="http://www.supermemo.com/english/ol/background.htm">spaced repetition</a> and it helps you spend as little time as possible reviewing words. You can think of it as your own personal language trainer, keeping detailed stats on what you've learned and drilling you only on the ones it thinks you're about to forget.
