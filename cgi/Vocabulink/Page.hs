-- |stdPage| takes a title, a list of dependencies, and list of HTML objects to
-- place into the body of the page. It automatically adds a standard header and
-- footer. It also includes @page.css@ and conditionally includes an Internet
-- Explorer-specific stylesheet for the few cases when there's no other way to
-- work around a defect in Internet Explorer that would otherwise seriously impact
-- usability.

-- If any JavaScript files are required, |stdPage| will automatically add a
-- @<noscript>@ warning to the top of the page.
